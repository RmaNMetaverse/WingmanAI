# **💘 Wingman AI \- Your Personal Dating Assistant**


![application screenshot](/screenshot.png)

**Wingman AI** is a lightweight, single-file web application designed to help you navigate the complex world of online dating. Powered by Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model, it acts as a real-time coach, analyzing bios, photos, and chat logs to suggest witty openers and smooth replies.

## **✨ Features**

* **📸 Screenshot Analysis:** Upload screenshots of a match's profile or your chat history. The AI "sees" the images to understand context, hobbies, and tone.  
* **🎭 Vibe Selection:** Choose your persona—from *Funny & Witty* to *Direct & Confident* or *Spicy*.  
* **🩺 Vibe Check:** Before suggesting a reply, the AI analyzes the conversation health and suggests the best approach (e.g., "She's interested, time to ask her out").  
* **🌍 Multilingual Support:** Select up to 3 languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Farsi). The AI generates the response in English and provides accurate translations instantly.  
* **🔒 Privacy First:** Your API key is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. No data is sent to any 3rd party server other than Google's official API for processing.
